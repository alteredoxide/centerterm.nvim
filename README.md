# centerterm.nvim

Yet another plugin for centering your editor in neovim.

- Do you have a wide monitor, and a terminal window that is wide enough that you  
find it uncomfortable to be constantly holding your gaze a bit to the left?
- Do you use a tiling window manager and sometimes rotate the window with your  
editor to a spot that shrinks the width?

You're in luck! This dinky little plugin--that probably has several gotchas that
I'm unaware of--is for you.

**Features**
- User-specified width for main editor buffer
- If specified width is exceeded, a new session will automatically center itself
- If your editor window shrinks below the specified width, then the centering  
will be removed, and vice-versa
